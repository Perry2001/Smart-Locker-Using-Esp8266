# Smart Lock using ESP8266 and Solenoid Valve Lock

This repository contains the source code and documentation for building a Smart Lock system using an ESP8266 microcontroller, a solenoid valve lock, and Firebase for database management and mobile app connectivity.

## Overview

This project is designed to create a smart and secure lock system that can be controlled remotely through a mobile app. The system uses a 4x4 keypad for user input, an ESP8266 for processing, a solenoid valve lock for physical locking/unlocking, a buzzer for feedback, and jumper cables for wiring.

The Arduino IDE is used for programming the ESP8266 and managing the software logic of the smart lock.

## Materials

To build this smart lock system, you will need the following materials:

- ESP8266 microcontroller
- Solenoid valve lock
- 4x4 keypad
- Buzzer
- Jumper cables

## Arduino IDE

The Arduino IDE is used for programming the ESP8266. Make sure you have the IDE installed on your computer before starting the project. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official Arduino website: [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## Firebase

Firebase is used as the database and connection between the smart lock and the mobile app. You will need to set up a Firebase project, configure authentication, and create a real-time database to make this system work. Please follow the Firebase setup instructions provided in the documentation.

## Repository Structure

- `src/` - Contains the Arduino sketch for the ESP8266.

  ```cpp
  // Sample Arduino code snippet
  void setup() {
      // Initialize the ESP8266 and other components
  }

  void loop() {
      // Main loop logic
  }
